Recipe API project

In this Javscript project i created an interface that allows me to grab recipes from a a food API, view all of the ingredients needed for the recipe, Adjust all of the ingrediants/servings etc. to suit my needs.

I also created a saved section using local storage so users can save recipes and come back and view saved recipes at any time.
